### Settings
This is where you setup your finance preferences. This setup is not required to use the app. But setting up accounts and recurring incomes will add more details on the charts and reports.

**How does this work ?**
- Similar to how manual accounting works, you need accounts to keep tack of where the money is coming from and where it is going.
- You also have to setup some sort of recurring income, e.g. salary. This will be helpful with monthly budgeting.
- You can also add one-time incomes and expenses. That will be included in the credit/debit calculations of that month.
- When adding an expense, it's better to choose an account in use and a category.
- Make use of tags to categorize your incomes and expenses. It'll help with analyzing reports better.
